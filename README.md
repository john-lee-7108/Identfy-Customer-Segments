# Identfy-Customer-Segments
Udacity Project - Unsupervised Machine Learning


In this project, our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. I looked at relationships between demographics features, organized the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained. 

Fell free to comment on how I can improve!
